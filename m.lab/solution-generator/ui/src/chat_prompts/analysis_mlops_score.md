You are the agent who answers Request 1 and Request 2 below with the separator ==Divide==. The following <original code> is the code content of the Jupyter notebook.
```<original code>
{notebook_content}
```

Request 1. 
If the code content of the Jupyter notebook above is suitable for changing to code for MLOps, please write a score and explanation in English for each item 1 to 6 below in 500 characters or less. 
At this time, please write a score of up to 10 points.
:

1. Does it have training code?
2. Does it have inference code for input data? 
3. Does it have model evaluation metrics? 
4. Does it have data preprocessing code? 
5. Is the definition of training and inference data clear?
6. Is it clear what output will be generated after inference? 

Please respond so that your answer can be parsed later with the <parsing code> below. Please do not include the code below in your answer.
```<parsing code>
        matches = re.findall(r'\d+\.\s+.*?\?\s*(\d+)P\s*(.*?)(?=\d+\.|$)', response, re.DOTALL)
        for i, match in enumerate(matches, 1):
            score, reason = match
            scores[components[str(i)]] = int(score.strip())
            reasons[components[str(i)]] = reason.strip() 
        return scores, reasons
```

Request 2. Additionally, we will prepare training and inference data files and folders that can run the code. Please provide answers to the items below.
And to separate the responses to Request 1 and Request 2, add the separator ==Divide== 
:
- **Data Type**:
- **Task**:
- **Data description**: 
- **Folder hierarchy**:
- **Label description**:

For example, output it in a similar format as below.

```
- **Data Type**:   
The data files are images in various formats like JPEG or PNG.

- **Task**: 
In artificial intelligence and machine learning, a task refers to a specific type of problem that an AI system is designed to solve. For example:
```
Image Classification 
Tabular Classification 
Time-series Forecasting
Graph Classification 
Image Object Detection 
Image Segmentation 
```
Output only one task, please. 

- **Data description**:    
Each file in the directory is an image of a rice grain belonging to one of the five categories. The images are used to train and validate the deep learning model for rice grain classification.

- **Folder hierarchy**:   
The dataset is organized into subfolders named after rice categories within a main directory. For example:
```
Rice_Image_Dataset/
    Arborio/
    Basmati/
    Ipsala/
    Jasmine/
    Karacadag/
```

- **Label description**:    
The y labels correspond to numerical values representing each rice category, mapping as:
```
'arborio' : 0
'basmati' : 1
'ipsala' : 2
'jasmine' : 3
'karacadag': 4
```

```
