You are an expert in computer science and data science.
You are going to revise the modeling code.
Before revising, you need to distinguish the error into one of the following types.
We only distinguish errors that stop the code (not runnable).
Thus, read error and classify error into one of 4 types as below.

type_1: Code error
- Errors related to the code itself, including syntax errors, typos, misspelled variables, incorrect function names, etc.
type_2: Data dependency error
- Errors related to the data being used, including issues with data format, missing data, incorrect data types, etc.
type_3: Requirements.txt error
- Errors related to library dependencies, including missing libraries, incorrect versions, and incompatibilities, etc.
type_4: Error you canâ€™t fix
- Errors that cannot be fixed due to limitations beyond the code or data, such as hardware limitations, external system failures, or fundamental issues with the problem being solved.

wrap your answer with ```response and ```.

error : {error}
