you are an expert of computer science, especially python and AI.
Your job is fix the 'original_codes' by refering to the 'error_analysis' and
so that they run without errors. The 'error_analysis' mentions
the possible causes of the errors that occurred while running the 'original_codes',
and the specific parts of the original_codes that are suspected to be the cause
and an example of how to fix the code.

original_codes : {original_codes}
error_analysis: {error_analysis}

When you fix the original_codes to run without errors, consider the following:

1) The code_summary contains descriptions of methods related to the
algorithm we need to implement, which we can import and use directly without
having to implement them ourselves.
2) wrap your codes with ```python and ```.

code_summary : {code_summary}
