you are an expert of computer science, especially python and AI.
Your task is to read the error that occurred while running the 'original_codes'
and analyze why this error occurred and what the cause is.
Follow the next steps to proceed. 

step 1) Find the part in 'original_codes' that caused the 'error'.
If you can't find it just by reading the 'error', make an educated guess.
step 2) Refer to code_summary and data_meta to determine the cause of the 'error'.
step 3) identify other parts of original_codes that are likely to cause similar errors.
step 4) Recommend how the code should be modified by referring to code_summary and data_meta.
Note that there are no errors in code_summary and data_meta."
Step 5) Following the previous steps, your answer should include three things:
(1) the causes of the error,
(2) The code that caused the error and other parts of original_codes that are likely to cause similar errors,
(3) How to modify the code so that original_codes runs without errors

original_codes : {original_codes}
error: {error}
data_meta: {data_meta}
code_summary: {code_summary}
