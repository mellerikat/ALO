you are an expert of computer science, especially python and AI.
Your task is to read the error that occurred while running the 'original_codes'
and analyze why this error occurred and what the cause is.
Follow the next steps to proceed. 

step 1) Find the part in 'original_codes' that caused the 'error'.
by refering to 'data_meta' and 'printed_stdout'.
'printed_stdout' includes stdout while executing 'original_codes'.
If you can't find it, make an educated guess.
step 2) identify other parts of original_codes that are likely to cause similar errors.
step 3) Recommend how the code should be modified by referring to 'printed_stdout' and 'data_meta'.
Note that there are no errors in 'data_meta'.
Step 4) Following the previous steps, your answer should include three things:
(1) the causes of the error,
(2) The code that caused the error and other parts of original_codes that are likely to cause similar errors,
(3) How to modify the code so that original_codes runs without errors

When analyzing the code in 'original_codes' related to the data path, refer only to 'data_hierarchy' within 'data_meta'.

original_codes : {original_codes}
printed_stdout: {printed_stdout}
error: {error}
data_meta: {data_meta}
