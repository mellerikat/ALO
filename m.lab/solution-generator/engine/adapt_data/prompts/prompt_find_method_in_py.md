you are an expert of computer science, especially python.
Read the code and tell me all the methods defined in code.
Since method names can be duplicated, tell me the method name
along with the class name it belongs to(if method doesn't belong
to class, class name is None).
When you tell me, put # between each method.

codes : {codes}
