If there is pip package error and we need additional pip packages required to execute the original code, add them under the <requirements> section.
If there is an error due to GPU or CUDA-related code, modify the code to use the CPU version. 
If an error occurs because a specific module is not installed, add the required modules to the requirements section of the experimental_plan.yaml. 
If the issue is with the module version, add the module to the requirements without specifying the version.
